Gives users the ability to load their virtual wallet balance using WooCommerce checkout.

## Description

User Wallet Credit System for Woocommerce provides each user of your WordPress website with their very own personal wallet. Users can load and there wallet with virtual money paid for using real money. The plugin provides a way to purchase items from your store while using their virtual money.

The plugin is still in its infant age and developers are welcome to extend.

## Features

*   Load wallet using credit products which then can be used for later purchases.
*   Ties into WooCommerce settings for currency formatting (simple).
*   Manually adjust user wallet balances if need be from the admin area.
*   Make purchases using the wallet balance.

## How To Use

*	Go to "Add Product" in Woocommerce and give the bundle a name.
*   Ensure the product type is "Simple Product", "Virtual" check box is checked, and "Credit" is checked as the products category. ⋅⋅⋅Under the inventory tab check "Enable this to only allow one of this item to be bought in a single order"
*	Save the product. Once saved you will see an input label "Credit Amount". Enter the credit amount for the product. (If the product's retail price is 10.00 then the credit amount should be 10.00). 
* Save the product again.

The plugin is setup not to list the credit bundles (products) in the store with other products. It is recommended that when you are offering users the ability to purchase products, that they do not have anything else in their cart.
