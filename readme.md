Gives users the ability to load a virtual wallet balance using WooCommerce checkout.

== Description ==

User Wallet Credit System is the first and original plugin for WooCommerce that provides each user of your WordPress website with their very own personal
wallet. Users can load their wallet with virtual money paid for using real money. The plugin provides a way to purchase items from your store while using their virtual money.
Store managers can also adjust user amount easily in the backend of WordPress.

**Starting with version 3.0, you will be able to adjust a users wallet by clicking on Users. You will now see the option to "Edit Wallet" under each user.**

**Features**:

* Easy to install
* Load wallet using credit products which then can be used for later purchases.
* Ties into WooCommerce settings for currency formatting (simple).
* Manually adjust user wallet balances if need be from the admin area.
* Make purchases using the wallet balance.

**How To Use**:

*	Go to "Add Product" in WooCommerce and give the bundle a name.
* Ensure the product type is "Simple Product", "Virtual" check box is checked, and "Credit" is checked as the products category. Under the inventory tab check "Enable this to only allow one of this item to be bought in a single order"
*	Save the product. Once saved you will see an input label "Credit Amount". Enter the credit amount for the product. (If the product's retail price is 10.00 then the credit amount should be 10.00). 
* Save the product again.

The plugin is setup not to list the credit bundles (products) in the store with other products. It is recommended that when you are offering users the ability to purchase products, that they do not have anything else in their cart.

**Shortcodes**:

Show Current User Wallet Balance:

`
[uw_balance display_username="true" separator=":" username_type="display_name"]
`

* display_username = (true|false) - Show username next to balance
* separator = (:|-) The character separating the username and wallet balance.
* username_type = (display_name|first_name|last_name|full_name)


Display a table containing the bundles (credit product) and "Buy Now" buttons:

`
[uw_product_table]
`

**Things to Note**:

* The plugins uses user meta fields to keep track of wallet balances. (_uw_balance).. Beware if you plan to 				change this. You could wipe everyones wallet balances out.
